	<h2>What is Gitools ?</h2>
	<p>
		Gitools is a framework for analysis and visualization of
		genomic data. It's being developed by 
		<a href="http://bg.upf.edu">Biomedical Genomics	Group</a>
		at <a href="http://grib.imim.es">GRIB</a> located at 
		<a href="http://www.prbb.org">PRBB</a> (Barcelona). 
		It is in a very early stage of development and so there are 
		still many things missing.
	</p>
	
	<h2>What kind of analysis can I do ?</h2>
	<p>
		For the time being it has been implemented only a kind of
		enrichment analysis that allows to perform statistical 
		tests for different conditions at the same time. There 
		are many different tests you can choose from:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>For	continuous data:
			<ul>
				<li>z-score of mean</li>
				<li>z-score of median</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>For binary data:
			<ul>
				<li>Binomial exact</li>
				<li>Binomial with Normal aproximation</li>
				<li>Binomial with Poisson aproximation</li>
				<li>Fisher's exact</li>
				<li>Chi square</li>
				<li>Hipergeometric</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		It includes some filters that can transform continuous data
		to binary data in order to use the later analysis with 
		continuous data.
	</p>
	<p> 
		For	multiple test correction we implement Bonferroni (more 
		restrictive) and Benjamini Hochberg False Discovery Rate
		(less restrictive).
	</p>
	<p>
		It is planned to integrate some analysis available in 
		R/Bioconductor as GOstats and GSEA, and q-values for FDR.
	</p>
	
	<h2>How can I visualize the results ?</h2>
	<p>
		The results are shown in table using a color scale that
		allows to identify easily the tests with significant results
		from the one's that are not. When you click in a test you can 
		view all the results obtained for that test in a convenient way.
		You can also do some things as filtering the results, sorting, 
		changing visibility of rows and columns, and so on that allows 
		you to better understand and interpret the results,	and also to 
		generate figures for your papers and presentations.
	</p>
	
	<h2>How can I use Gitools ?</h2>
	<p>
		Gitools has a graphical interface that allows to perform 
		analysis and browse and work with the results. It also 
		contains a command line tool to perform analysis 
		(useful when used with scripts). It is being developed 
		with Java, so if you have installed the Java runtime you 
		can	download and start using it very easily. It requires 
		at least the version 1.6 of Java.
