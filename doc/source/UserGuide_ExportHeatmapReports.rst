ExportHeatmapReports
====================

It is possible to export short html reports with tables for the data related with some analysis results or even the results. To do that you have to open first a heatmap for the results of any analysis. Then select a cell, a row or a column of your interest. Under the heatmap there is a tool bar with some options, click in update button and then a table will appear. You can select if you want to view a table with the related data or with the results. Once you are done click on export button and specify a file name to save it.
