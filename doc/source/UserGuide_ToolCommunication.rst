Tool to tool communication

Communication 
-------------
Gitools can interact and be interacted with through :doc:`UserGuide_ExternalControl` and is integrated with some web tools and platforms. 


Integrative Genomics Browser (IGV)
..................................
IGV is a genomics browser which can send heatmaps to Gitools through the **load** command. Gitools can then send 'locate' commands for selected rows in the heatmaps to IGV (http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv) via the IGV logo in the Gitools toolbar. This makes it easy to spot and compare genes of interest within IGV.


GenomeSpace
...........
GenomeSpace (http://www.genomespace.org/) is a platform to store genomics data and connects multiple bioinformatics tools, Gitools included.
Via the GenomeSpace icon in the toolbar, a user is able to connect to the server and download data sets.
