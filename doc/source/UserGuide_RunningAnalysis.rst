Running analysis
==================================


There are several analysis implemented in Gitools:


- :doc:`UserGuide_Enrichment`
- :doc:`UserGuide_Correlations`
- :doc:`UserGuide_Combinations`
- :doc:`UserGuide_Overlaps`
- :doc:`UserGuide_GroupComparison`
- :doc:`UserGuide_Oncodrive`


The analyses are available in two ways:
 - Selecting :code:`File -> New`. This way will always ask to locate the data on your computer.
 - When a heatmap already loaded, the analyses become available through the menu :code:`Analysis` and will take as input data the currently selected heatmap.
