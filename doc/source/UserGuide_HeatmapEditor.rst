A heatmap is a graphical representation of data where the values taken by a variable in a two-dimensional map are represented as colors. In the case of Gitools we can represent both numerical matrices and tables in heatmaps.

There are many applications for drawing heatmaps but Gitools allows also editing and configuring it interactively and with many options. Apart from that Gitools allows also easy navigation over the cells and exploration of the data or result attributes associated to each cell.

As an example of the kind of heatmaps that can be represented see the following screenshots:
