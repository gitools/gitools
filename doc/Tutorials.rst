CASE STUDY 2: Studying the expression profile of 156 lung tumors and adjacent normal lung tissue samples
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Identify pathways which genes are differentially expressed in various groups of samples






Compare the expression profile of samples using correlations






Run Oncodrive to identify the genes that are significantly up-regulated taking into account a set of tumour samples






Compare and combine the significantly up-regulated genes in our experiment and other lung experiments imported from IntOGen






Compare the overlap of significantly up-regulated genes in our experiment and in other lung experiments imported from IntOGen
