CASE STUDY 1: Finding the Biological Processes enriched among genes significantly up-regulated in different types of cancer
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Import a data matrix from IntOGen that contains p-values for significantly up-regulated genes in each tumor morphology type






Import a module file that maps all human genes to KEGG Pathways and the annotations of these terms






Run an enrichment analysis to test which pathways are enriched among genes significantly up-regulated in different types of cancer






Explore the heatmap with the enrichment analysis results by sorting, filtering, hiding and moving rows and columns






Edit properties of the heatmaps: change color scale, add annotations, change font size and edit grid






Export the results of the enrichment analysis as an image and as a table containing the details of the statistic results





CASE STUDY 2: Studying the expression profile of 156 lung tumors and adjacent normal lung tissue samples
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Identify pathways which genes are differentially expressed in various groups of samples






Compare the expression profile of samples using correlations






Run Oncodrive to identify the genes that are significantly up-regulated taking into account a set of tumour samples






Compare and combine the significantly up-regulated genes in our experiment and other lung experiments imported from IntOGen






Compare the overlap of significantly up-regulated genes in our experiment and in other lung experiments imported from IntOGen





CASE STUDY 3: Functional protein divergence in the evolution of Homo sapiens
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Analyse the conservation patterns of genes involved in different biological processes                                                                          





CASE STUDY 4: Studying the regulatory programs governing the expression in different tissues
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Identify the transcription factors involved in the regulation of expression in different tissues                                                                       






Compare the expression pattern of genes expressed in different tissues                                                                                                                                              





CASE STUDY 5: Experimental regulatory modules in cancer
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Study the misregulation in different cancer types of modules derived from binding experiments such as ChIP-sequencing                                                                       





CASE STUDY 6: Studying multi-dimensional cancer data with Gitools
